# SensorSegmentation
In recent years, data stream segmentation has become a very important topic in machine learning science, as more and more data can be treated as data streams. Most of this data is characterized as high speed, non-stationary data distribution and unlimited length, examples of which can be seen in activity detection, credit card transactions and telecommunications. Concept drift occurs when the distribution of data streams changes over time. Concept drift requires the adjustment of classifiers to adapt to new conditions. The type of changes can be classified as abrupt, gradual, incremental and recurring concept drift. Real-world applications are always a combination of different types of concept drifts. In this thesis, by using 4 commonly used methods in the chunk-based classification of data streams (ACDWM, DWMIL, DUE and KUE), a relationship is made in order to compare the robustness of the algorithms with each other against noise and also considering the imbalance ratio and concept drift is presented. The mentioned algorithms were examined and tested with 4 datasets. By examining the graphs obtained from entering different amounts of noise, imbalance ratio and concept drift to the data, an efficient relationship has been obtained.
